Turn off unneeded Google Play Services services.

Before flash module please read below
>I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF SOME YOUR FEATURE FROM YOUR DEVICE. BEFORE FLASH THE MODULE, PLEASE READ LINE CODES AND SELECT GOOGLE SERVICES YOU NEEDS. YOU ARE FLASHING THIS MAGISK MODULE AND ITS YOUR CHOICE TO DO IT OR NOT TO DO IT AND YOU'RE THE ONE DOING IT. I JUST WANT TO HELP OTHERS OUT.

# Compatible Devices
* Universal
* Android 7 - 13

# Does it work the same way as the magisk module Universal GMS Doze?
No, the way the Universal GMS Doze module works makes Google Play Services run in battery saving mode while Disable Unwanted Google Play Services turns off unneeded services.

# Upcoming Features
* Add key selection function for selecting disable service. (Meanwhile, if there are several services needed, you can delete the line code in service.sh)

# Troubleshoot
If you want to turn on the location with minimal service.

> pm enable com.google.android.gms/com.google.android.location.internal.GoogleLocationManagerService

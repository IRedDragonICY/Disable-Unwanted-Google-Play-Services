Turn off unneeded Google Play Services services.

_Warning! Some features google may not work._

# Compatible Devices
* Universal
* Minimal Android 7
# Does it work the same way as the magisk module Universal GMS Doze?
No, the way the Universal GMS Doze module works makes Google Play Services run in battery saving mode while Disable Unwanted Google Play Services turns off unneeded services.

# Upcoming Features
* Add key selection function for selecting disable service. (Meanwhile, if there are several services needed, you can delete the line code)

# Support
if you like this project, you can give a star so that it can encourage me too (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠)

Before flash module, please read below:
>I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE SOME YOUR FEATURE FROM YOUR DEVICE IF DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY. BEFORE FLASH THE MODULE, PLEASE READ LINE CODES AND SELECT GOOGLE SERVICES YOU NEEDS. YOU ARE FLASHING THIS MAGISK MODULE AND ITS YOUR CHOICE TO DO IT OR NOT TO DO IT AND YOU'RE THE ONE DOING IT. I JUST WANT TO HELP OTHERS OUT.

# Compatible Devices
* Universal
* Android 7 - 13

# Does it work the same way as the magisk module Universal GMS Doze?
No, the way the Universal GMS Doze module works makes Google Play Services run in battery saving mode while Disable Unwanted Google Play Services turns off unneeded services.

# Upcoming Features
* Add key selection function for selecting disable service. (Meanwhile, if there are several services needed, you can delete the line code in service.sh)

# Uninstall
Here's how to remove the module:
1. Delete module from Magisk Module list.
2. After delete the module, download [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/tag/v0.118.0).
3. Copy script from [uninstall.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IRedDragonICY/Disable-Unwanted-Google-Play-Services/main/uninstall.sh). Wait till script done.
